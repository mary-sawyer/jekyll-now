Hi all, I've spent a while aggregating and pruning my RSS feeds using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), and I thought I'd share!

My feeds are available to download [here](https://ln.sync.com/dl/6d9180c00/pkjn98yv-26agpj6m-875upfn5-ecfxtizg)

The password is mary-sawyer.github.io :)

I'm hosting the file on a service called Sync that I generally use for cloud storage. They have excellent privacy features that come with links, but I didn't enable it in this instance for compatibility reasons.

What do you use for backing up files?
